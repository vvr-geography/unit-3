        <h2> How Forcasted Heat Risk Impacts Incarcerated Communities </h2>
        <p> <b>Incarcerated communities are on the frontlines of climate change.</b> Many prisons, jails, and detention
            facilities lack the appropriate mechanisms to keep incarcerated folks safe and comfortable during extreme
            heat events. Moreover, most also lack emergency preparedness plans for climate related emergencies and
            climate adaptation plans for the increasingly devastating forcasted climate impacts.</p>
        <p> This map shoes the historical heat risk for U.S. Counties by showing the number of days at or above a
            certain heat index. The chart below visualizes the number of people incarcerated by county and projections
            for heat risk based on various levels of climate change.
